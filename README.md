## How Works ? 

**Steps :-**

1) First It will collect the data real time
2) Then We It will save that data
3) When We call the Recognition Function It will compare with the recorded data 
4) We can't give garrenty that It will give 100% Perfect Every time
5) Because We have used Normal Algorithm in this project 
6) We can Use this for Basics & Inermediate Projects with addition of Including some more Frames
7) We can also capture the Eyes and smile in this


## opencv : data : haarcascades

[Haarcascades](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades)

## Future Scope ðŸ”®

We can also use different haarcascade files to detect different things and we can also detect that things using it. 

## Applications 

1) To handle the large databases haar cascade classifier is the best detector in terms of speed and reliability. 
2) Even the image is affected by illumination, face detection results are more accurate using haar cascade classifier.
